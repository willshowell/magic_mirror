# Magic Mirror
Magic mirror on the wall.

I've been recently inspired (yet again) to build a smart mirror for apartment. Only this time, I feel confident about being able to put all the steps together.

##Potential Features

####Weather
This is a no brainer. Using forecast.io, I will display an icon and quick text blurb. Digging deeper could show a line graph of hourly temperature and precipitation.

####Calendar
Combined with a todo list, I could generate a list of timed events and untimed tasks for the day. Digging deeper could show the next several days.

####News
A simple list of the top 5 news headlines could be shown. Digging deeper could potentially show the whole article? 

####xkcd
Ladyada's shows the most recent xkcd comic, and I think that's a glorious idea.

####Recognition
Using the API from indico.io, it could be pretty simple to recognize a face in the image and provide personal context to the disply. If motion is detected in the frame, then an image could be captured and analyzed.

####Emotion Detection
Also using indico.io, it would be awesome to detect the emotion of the person in front of the mirror. Personal messages could be shown (e.g. 'You look great', 'Cheer up', 'Rough night?', etc) **or** it could require a big bright smile to unlock.

####Voice Control
Everyone has this listed as a future update item, and I will too. "Digging deeper" could be simple be activiated by saying 'show more news' or 'show more weather' or 'go home'.
